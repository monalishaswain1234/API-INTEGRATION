# API-INTEGRATION 

*COMPANY*:- CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*:- MONALISHA SWAIN

*INTERN ID*:- CT04DF1291

*DOMAIN*:- FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*:- 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*:- NEELA SANTOSH
** What We Did:
Developed a fully responsive weather information webpage where users can search for any city to get live weather data such as temperature, humidity, and condition. This was achieved by connecting the frontend directly to the OpenWeatherMap API.

 Tools Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

API: OpenWeatherMap (Public REST API)

UX Enhancement: Basic responsive design for mobile and desktop

 Why This is Applicable:
API consumption is fundamental in frontend and full-stack development. Every real-world application today fetches data — whether it’s weather, stock prices, social media feeds, or user content. This project teaches how to use RESTful APIs, handle JSON responses, and update the DOM dynamically. It mirrors the process used in building real-time dashboards, booking apps, and weather or travel platforms. **
